# ML Folder - Logistic Regression Predictions

This folder contains a pre-trained Logistic Regression model along with the necessary files to make predictions without retraining the model.  

---

## File Structure

ml_folder/
│
├── dataset_2nd.csv # Original dataset or any new dataset to predict
├── logistic_model.joblib # Pre-trained Logistic Regression model
├── scaler.joblib # Pre-fitted scaler used during training
├── predict.py # Script to make predictions
└── predictions.csv # Generated after running predict.py

## How to Use

1. **Ensure Python and required libraries are installed**:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
Place your dataset (with the same feature columns) in this folder. You can use dataset_2nd.csv or replace it with a new CSV file.

Run the prediction script:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py
Check the predictions:

After running the script, a new file predictions.csv will be created.

This file will include a new column Predictions with the model's output for each row in your dataset.
